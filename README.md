# BuildItBigger

This is an application developed using GCE (Google cloud Endpoints) to fetch jokes from the cloud and made them accessible on both phone and tablets devices through a custom java library.

<h2>Install</h2>

On Linux and Mac OS, you can open the project on Android Studio and run ./gradlew assembleDebug and adb -d install app/{path-to-your-apk} which is often app/build/outputs/apk/{apk_file}. Alternatively you can simply click on the run button of the IDE and those steps will be ran automatically and load the application on your mobile or virtual device.
